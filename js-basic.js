// creating variables
// Rules to create the variables
// Any varable to be created or defined, we need to use these keywords
// var, let you change or override the data after it is created
// const, you can not change the data after it is created
/* In programming, we want to write the code from var or in other terms (ambiguity)
to surety(predictability). Both take the same memory.*/

var name = "John";
let phone = 41444445;
const dob = "12/12/20";
// after line 15, go to the browser, click console, type name - "John" should appear

console.log(name, phone, dob);
// line 18 shows multiple variables written in one line
// console.log(name);
// console.log(phone);
// console.log(name);
// console.log(dob);

// console is the object, and log is the method to print the item

/* if a variable is not defined, or type casted as 'var' then by default
it is var. var can be overridden, 'const' and 'let' cannot be overridden*/
